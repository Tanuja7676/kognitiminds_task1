        <h2>The Evolution of Computers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>üñ• <b>Why Were Computers Invented?</b><br>
        Before computers, people did calculations by hand, which was slow and had many mistakes. To solve this problem, machines were created to make work faster and more accurate.</p>

        <p>‚öô <b>What is a Computer?</b><br>
        A computer is an electronic device that takes input, processes it, and gives an output. It helps in solving problems, storing data, and making tasks easier.</p>

        üîπ Abacus (3000 BC) ‚Äì First counting tool.<br>
        üîπ Pascaline (1642) ‚Äì A simple calculator.<br>
        üîπ Analytical Engine (1837) ‚Äì A design for the first real computer by Charles Babbage.</p>

        <p>üìù <b>The First Step Towards Programming</b><br>
        The Analytical Engine (1837) by Charles Babbage introduced the idea of a machine that could follow instructions, but it was Ada Lovelace who wrote the first-ever programming algorithm in the 1840s. She is known as the "World‚Äôs First Programmer."</p>

        <p>üíæ <b>How Did Early Computers Work?</b><br>
        Before modern programming languages, computers used machine code (binary ‚Äì 0s and 1s) to perform tasks. Programmers had to write complex instructions directly for the hardware.</p>

        <p>üìú <b>Early Programming Languages:</b><br>
        üîπ Assembly Language (1940s) ‚Äì A simple form of machine code.<br>
        üîπ Fortran (1957) ‚Äì The first high-level programming language.<br>
        üîπ COBOL (1959) ‚Äì Used in business and finance.</p>

        <p>These early languages made coding easier and more structured, leading to the creation of powerful programming languages like C, Java, and Python! üöÄ</p>
